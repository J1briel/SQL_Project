# SQL_Project

Welcome to my SQL GitHub repository, where I share my journey into the fascinating world of SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a powerful tool that allows us to interact with and manipulate data in relational databases. My exploration of SQL began as a personal quest to unlock the potential of data management and analysis. In this repository, I document my learning process, achievements, and the projects I've undertaken to strengthen my SQL skills.
